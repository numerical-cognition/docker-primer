# Links

Links are how Docker containers talk to each other [through TCP/IP ports](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/). [Atlassian](https://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/11/docker-all-the-things-at-atlassian-automation-and-wiring/) show worked examples. You can also resolve [links by hostname](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/#/updating-the-etchosts-file).

This has been deprecated to some extent by [user-defined networks](https://docs.docker.com/network/).

NOTE: If you want containers to ONLY communicate with each other through links, start the docker daemon with `-icc=false` to disable inter process communication.

If you have a container with the name CONTAINER (specified by `docker run --name CONTAINER`) and in the Dockerfile, it has an exposed port:

```
EXPOSE 1337
```

Then if we create another container called LINKED like so:

```sh
docker run -d --link CONTAINER:ALIAS --name LINKED user/wordpress
```

Then the exposed ports and aliases of CONTAINER will show up in LINKED with the following environment variables:

```sh
$ALIAS_PORT_1337_TCP_PORT
$ALIAS_PORT_1337_TCP_ADDR
```

And you can connect to it that way.

To delete links, use `docker rm --link`.

Generally, linking between docker services is a subset of "service discovery", a big problem if you're planning to use Docker at scale in production.
